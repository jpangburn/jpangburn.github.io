[Personal website](https://jpangburn.github.io/)

This repository uses Jekyll with Github Pages to create a personal website using the "minima" gem.  This gives a simplified setup for a blog style website.  To make a website like this, I recommend you start at the Jekyll website [doc page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to learn about Jekyll, and [GitHub's Working with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) to get the idea of what GitHub pages can do for you.  Then [GitHub's Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

I found that it really helps to understand Jekyll and a bit about "bundler" that is described there.  Get a test site working using the quickstart, and do the tutorial too.  Then try the GitHub pages instructions- it seems that sometimes a step or two related to bundler is omitted, as least as far as setting up on a Mac went for me.  But understanding bundler a bit lets you fix those issues and get a site running.  You can also use a site like mine (or anyone else who uses Jekyll on GitHub Pages) as a guide of what Gemfile and other stuff you need.
