Software Architect is probably the best label for my professional life.  This site has posts that basically provide unsolicited advice and opinions on things that I'm familiar with.  I'm no particular expert in these matters other than what my own limited experience grants me, so take my advice and honestly anyone's advice who purports to be an "expert" of some sort, as merely something to consider and make your own decisions.
