Unsolicited Advice is operated as a static website to provide hopefully useful information.  As a static website, there is no database operated by this site collecting information about you or your activities.  That said, Google Analytics is used to get information about how much traffic this site receives, and Google Adsense is used which is collecting data in its own way as well.  If you would like to know what data those systems collect, you should look to Google's privacy policy ["How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps"](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

Some pages may have comments enabled, and those comments will be stored by whatever service is chosen to operate the comments on a given page.  Those comments will be publicly viewable, and the data may be mined by the comment system owner.
